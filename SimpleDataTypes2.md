# Booleans, string interpolation, and checkpoint 1
## Storing Truth With Booleans
- boolean stores True or False
- `let filename="paris.jpg"`
- `print(filename.hasSuffix(".jpg"))` -> True

- assign true or false as a value to the variable or constant
  - `let gooddogs=true`
  - ! is a not for the boolean

## Joining strings together
- join using +
- `let firstPart="Hello,"`
- `let secondPart="world!"`
- `let greeting = firstPart+secondPart`
- operator (+) overloading
  - can do different things depending on how used.

- `let luggageCode= "1"+"2"+"3"+"4"+"5"`
- it goes through and concatonates two at a time 12, 123, 1234, 1235

- string interpolation
- backslash constant variable name in parenthesis
- `let name = "Taylor"`
- `let age=26`
- `let message ="Hello, my name is \(name) and I'm \(age) years old."`

## Summary Simple Data
- constants using let and variables using var
- strings can be strong or whole novels
  - have functions such as count and functions
- whole numbers are called ints
- decimals are called doubles
- store t/f in booleans
- string interpolation makes combining strings easy
